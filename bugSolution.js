The issue was resolved by correctly configuring the build process to handle Tailwind CSS. In my case, I was using Webpack, and the solution involved adding the `tailwindcss-webpack-plugin` plugin. This plugin ensures that the Tailwind directives are correctly processed during the build step.  If using a different build system, refer to its documentation for guidance on integrating Tailwind CSS. In addition, the `purge` option (now `content`) in `tailwind.config.js` needed to be correctly set to include all the HTML files where Tailwind classes are used. Here's an example of the updated `tailwind.config.js` and the relevant parts of the webpack config:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.html', './src/**/*.js'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
const path = require('path');
const TailwindcssWebpackPlugin = require('tailwindcss-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  // ...other webpack configurations
  plugins: [
    new TailwindcssWebpackPlugin(),
    // ... other plugins
  ],
};
```
By adding this plugin and ensuring the correct paths are included in the `content` option of `tailwind.config.js`, the production build now correctly applies Tailwind CSS classes.
